      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the App includes:
      </p>
      
      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Personal & Health/Fitness Data</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, and specific Health &amp; Fitness data that you voluntarily give to us when you register with the App. This includes demographic information and physical attributes critical to our analysis, such as your height, weight, birthdate, skill level, and shooting side.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Device & Diagnostics Data</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Device information such as your mobile device ID number, model, and manufacturer, version of your operating system, phone number, country, and location. We also collect diagnostic and crash data (including your user ID and email) to help us troubleshoot and improve the App&apos;s stability.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Usage & Analytics Data</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Information our servers automatically collect when you access the App, such as your IP address, your browser type, your operating system, your access times, and the pages you have viewed. We also collect specific analytics events linked to your user ID (such as drill selections and job completions) to understand how you interact with the App.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">User Uploaded Content & Chat Data</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        When you use the App, you may upload videos and other content for analysis. This includes video recordings of your hockey activities. In addition, we collect conversational data from chat sessions (such as interactions with OpenIce and StatsChat) about your performance. This data is transmitted to our backend for processing to provide personalized feedback.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">Push Notification Tokens</h3>

        We may collect data necessary to process your payment if you make purchases.

      <p className="mb-4">
        We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse. Any information disclosed online is vulnerable to interception and misuse by unauthorized parties. Therefore, we cannot guarantee complete security if you provide personal information.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">6. DATA RETENTION AND DELETION</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Video Content:</strong> When you upload a video for analysis, the raw video file is stored securely in our cloud storage. After processing is complete (typically within one hour), the video file is permanently deleted by our automated workers. The temporary processing document associated with the job is retained for 7 days before being automatically purged. A lightweight, text-based result summary of the analysis is retained permanently in your user profile to track your progress over time.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Analysis Results Retention:</strong> Analysis results, including scorecards, chat logs, and coaching feedback provided in the App, are retained for the lifetime of your account or until you delete your account.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">7. AI/ML PROCESSING DISCLOSURE</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The App uses artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to analyze your uploaded videos and provide feedback. When you upload a video, our AI systems—specifically powered by the <strong>Google Gemini API</strong>—process the video content to:

      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">8. PUBLIC SCOREBOARD</h2>

        <li>Participation in the scoreboard is optional and requires your affirmative consent.</li>
