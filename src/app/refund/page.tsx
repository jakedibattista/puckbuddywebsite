      <p className="mb-4">Last Updated: October 6, 2025</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">1. General Policy</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        This policy outlines the terms related to refunds, payments, and subscriptions for the Buddy LLC mobile application (the &quot;App&quot;) downloaded from the Apple App Store. All financial transactions are processed through Apple and are subject to their terms and conditions.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">2. Refund Policy</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We offer a refund window of ten (10) days from the date of your initial purchase.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">How to Request a Refund:</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        All purchases and refund requests for the Buddy LLC App are processed directly through the Apple App Store. We do not have the ability to issue refunds directly.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        To request a refund within the 10-day window, you must do so through your Apple ID purchase history.
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>Visit Apple&apos;s problem reports page: <a href="https://reportaproblem.apple.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-500 hover:underline">reportaproblem.apple.com</a></li>
        <li>Sign in with your Apple ID and password.</li>

        <li>Follow the on-screen prompts to describe the issue and submit your request.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Please note that all refund requests are subject to Apple&apos;s terms and conditions, and final approval is at Apple&apos;s sole discretion.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">3. Monthly Subscription Terms</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If you do not request and receive a refund from Apple within the 10-day window, your account will be automatically enrolled in a recurring monthly subscription.
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li><strong>Subscription Fee:</strong> You will be charged $10.00 USD (plus any applicable taxes) on a monthly basis.</li>
        <li><strong>Billing Cycle:</strong> Your first monthly charge will occur 30 days after your initial purchase date. Subsequent charges will recur approximately every 30 days thereafter.</li>
        <li><strong>Payment Method:</strong> All subscription payments are managed and charged by Apple through the payment method associated with your Apple ID.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">4. Managing or Cancelling Your Subscription</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        You are in full control of your subscription and can cancel it at any time. All subscription management is handled through your Apple account settings.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        To avoid being charged for the next billing cycle, you must cancel your subscription at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">How to Cancel on an iPhone or iPad:</h3>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>Open the Settings app.</li>
        <li>Tap your name at the top.</li>
        <li>Tap &quot;Subscriptions.&quot;</li>
        <li>Find and tap the Buddy LLC subscription.</li>
        <li>Tap &quot;Cancel Subscription.&quot;</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If you cancel, you will retain access to the App&apos;s premium features until the end of your current paid period, after which your access will be discontinued.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">5. Price Changes</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Buddy LLC reserves the right to change the subscription price in the future. We will provide you with reasonable notice of any price changes through the App or by other means, giving you the opportunity to cancel your subscription before the new price takes effect.
