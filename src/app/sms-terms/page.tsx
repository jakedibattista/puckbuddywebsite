        When you opt-in to the service, we will send you a message to confirm your signup.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        By opting into messages, you agree to receive recurring automated marketing and informational text messages from Buddy Tech. Automated messages may be sent using an automatic telephone dialing system to the mobile telephone number you provided when signing up or any other number that you designate.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Message frequency varies, and additional mobile messages may be sent periodically based on your interaction with Buddy Tech. Buddy Tech reserves the right to alter the frequency of messages sent at any time to increase or decrease the total number of sent messages. Buddy Tech also reserves the right to change the short code or phone number or alphanumeric sender where messages are sent.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Your usual message and data rates may apply. If you have any questions about your text plan or data plan, it is best to contact your mobile provider. Your mobile provider is not liable for delayed or undelivered messages.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Your consent to receive marketing messages is not a condition of purchase.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Carriers</h2>

        Messages will provide instructions to unsubscribe either by texting STOP or through an included link. After you unsubscribe, we will send you a message to confirm that you have been unsubscribed and no more messages will be sent. If you would like to receive messages from Buddy Tech again, just sign up as you did the first time and Buddy Tech will start sending messages to you again.
